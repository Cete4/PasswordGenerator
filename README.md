## Password Generator
This project I worked on expanding my abilities using Javascript and using error first programming to generate a password.

## Motivation
This already exists in many forms but I wanted to make my own attempt.

## Build status
This build is still in progress with methods to be tweaked and features to be added.

## Code style
Not in a  specific code style. As I'm still learning and improving.
